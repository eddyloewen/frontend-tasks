# Frontend Tasks

## Introduction

Frontend Tasks provides a simple and clean API for common tasks and build steps in modern frontend development. Tasks includes bundling and minifying JavaScript and CSS, Copying files, Linting JavaScript and CSS, etc. Under the hood it uses gulp and several gulp plugins to run the tasks.

If configuring any build tools (gulp, grunt, webpack, etc.) was ever to complicated - Frontend Tasks will cover most of the cases.

Frontend Tasks was heavily inspired by [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/) (wrapper around webpack).
